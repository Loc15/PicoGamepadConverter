# PICO-GAMEPAD-CONVERTER

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/O4O8TQSC8)

PicoGamepadCoverter is a project designed for RP2040, RP2350 or Raspberry Pi Pico and variants, that enabling switch to different gamepad modes using a gamepad as input. Re-use old gamepads that don't support USB connections or make compatibles with certain platform.

---
## Features

- Read input from USB and Bluetooth controllers.
- Read inputs from no USB peripherals.
- Web interface to choose between modes.
- Different out modes (Dinput, Xinput, Switch, Bluetooth, PS1/PS2, Gamecube, WII)
- Easy to use, no overcomplicated options.

---
## Getting Started

To get started with PicoGamepadConverter, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller or another RP2040 or RP2350 boards.
- OTG cable (micro-USB or USB-C it depends on your board)
- USB female connector (Recommended be the same type of OTG cable)
- USB cable (micro-USB or USB-C it depends on your board)
- Two push buttons (_Optional but RECOMMENDED!_)
- Breadboard (_Optional_)

### Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/Loc15/PicoGamepadConverter/releases) the build program and copy on the microcontroller.

2. Make the connections.

![conections2](./docs/bread_board2.jpg)

3. Go to configuration mode pressing the button on 18 GPIO on start. On WEB mode the LED start to blink.

4. Choose the modes on the web server. Access http://192.168.3.1 in a web browser to begin configuration.

5. Connect your gamepad, when it connected successfully the LED on the board gonna turn on.

6. Enjoy!


## Additional information

- The LED onboard indicates that a gamepad has been mounted successfully, it works on all host modes except **Keyboard PS/2**

- The additional USB female connector PINS are **16** and **17 GPIO**. 

---
#### PS/2 KEYBOARD

- The connection for Keyboard PS/2 are on **19 GPIO** for **DATA PIN** and **20 GPIO** for **CLOCK PIN**.

![keyboard_schematic](./docs/keyboard_pinout.png)
![keyboard_connector](./docs/keyboard_connector.jpg)
![keyboard_pc](./docs/keyboard_pc.jpg)

---
#### BLUETOOTH

- Bluetooth modes only works on Pico W.

- On **Bluetooth device mode**, the host connection is on **native usb female connector on the microcontroller**.

- On **Bluetooth device mode** if the LED blinks means that microcontroller not is connected still. The LED bliks faster than on WEB mode.

- On **Bluetooth device mode** if the LED is solid on means that it is connected.

- On **Bluetooth host mode** you must put the mac address of your gamepad. You can get this address connecting you gamepad to a PC or a mobile phone. This address _should_ be put just once time, next time you just need choose the mode.

---

#### WII

![wii_setup](./docs/wii_setup.jpg)

- You need go to config and set the Sensor-Bar Position on the Wii as **Above TV**.

- To connect to wii console you need press sync button.

- If the LED blinks means that microcontroller not is connected still. The LED bliks faster than on WEB mode.

- If the LED is solid on means that it is connected.

- It doesn't work on homebrew application for now. Still you can play wii games via homebrew, just open the game on a loader and on game try to sync.

- You can change between modes pressing **X** and **Y** (Xbox layout) at the same time.

- For controllers without **guide button** the home button is right thumbstick button.

- You can simulate movement for games that require it pressing the **LB** (Xbox layout) / the left shoulder button.

---
#### PS1/PS2

- The connection for PS1/PS2 controllers (host mode) are on **19 GPIO** for **COMMAND PIN**, **20 GPIO** for **CLOCK PIN**, **21 GPIO** for **ATTENTION PIN** and **22 GPIO** for **DATA PIN**.

![ps1_schematic](./docs/ps1_pinout.png)
![ps1_connector](./docs/ps1_connector.jpg)
![ps1_pc](./docs/ps1_pc.jpg)

- The connection for PS1/PS2 device mode are on **19 GPIO** for **DATA PIN**, **20 GPIO** for **COMMAND PIN**, **21 GPIO** for **ATTENTION PIN**, **22 GPIO** for **CLOCK PIN** and **26 GPIO** for **ACKNOWLEDGE PIN**.

![ps1_ps2_device_connection](./docs/PS1_PS2_pinout.png)

- On PS1/PS2 device mode, the host connection is on **native usb female connector on the microcontroller**.

- On PS1/PS2 device mode, the alternative connection for Keyboard PS/2 are on **5 GPIO** for **DATA PIN** and **6 GPIO** for **CLOCK PIN**.

- On PS1/PS2 device mode, the alternative connection for PS1/PS2 controllers are on **5 GPIO** for **COMMAND PIN**, **6 GPIO** for **CLOCK PIN**, **7 GPIO** for **ATTENTION PIN** and **8 GPIO** for **DATA PIN**.

---
### Gamecube

- The connection for Gamecube device mode is **19 GPIO** for **DATA PIN**.

![gamecube_device_connection](./docs/Gamecube_pinout.png)

- On Gamecube device mode, the host connection is on **native usb female connector on the microcontroller**.

- On Gamecube device mode, the alternative connection for Keyboard PS/2 are on **5 GPIO** for **DATA PIN** and **6 GPIO** for **CLOCK PIN**.

- On Gamecube device mode, the alternative connection for PS1/PS2 controllers are on **5 GPIO** for **COMMAND PIN**, **6 GPIO** for **CLOCK PIN**, **7 GPIO** for **ATTENTION PIN** and **8 GPIO** for **DATA PIN**.

---
## Modes
Exist two parameter to choose on web interface, **host** and **device**. The first is the input and another one the output.

### HOST
#### USB MODES
- Xinput: Support Xbox controllers or Xinput compatibles controllers.
- Dinput: Support generic gamepads, PS4, PS3 and 8BITDO controllers.

#### SPECIAL MODES
- Keyboard/PS2: Support keyboards with PS/2 connector.
- PS1/PS2: Support PS1 and PS2 controllers. (_Put a pull-up resistor on data pin_)

 ### DEVICE

### Building

```
git clone https://github.com/Loc15/PicoGamepadConverter
cd PicoGamepadConverter/
git submodule update --init
cd pico-sdk/
git submodule update --init
cd ..
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src -DPICO_BOARD=your_pico
make
```

#### Else you can use a docker image

_The instructions below have been successful on Windows (11) but should mostly apply to Linux_

1. (windows) Install Docker Desktop
2. Setup pico sdk environment by following  [this guide](https://community.element14.com/products/raspberry-pi/b/blog/posts/working-with-pi-pico-c-c-projects-easily-a-docker-approach)
3. Open Docker Desktop
4. Find the `pc1` container, click on `â‹®` and select `Open in Terminal` then type in these commands:

```
cd /home/dev
mkdir pico
cd pico
git clone https://github.com/Loc15/PicoGamepadConverter
cd PicoGamepadConverter/
git submodule update --init
cd pico-sdk/
git submodule update --init
```
5. Wait a bit then:

```
cd ..
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src -DPICO_BOARD=your_pico
```

6. Wait a bit more then:

```
make
```

7. Wait some more, then reset your Pico (or other board) with BOOTSEL held down - the instructions below assume the Pico will be drive D:
8. Open a **windows command line** (i.e. windows powershell - NOT the docker terminal) and type in:

```
cd Downloads
docker cp pc1:/home/dev/pico/PicoGamepadConverter/build/PicoGamepadConverter.uf2 .
cp PicoGamepadConverter.uf2 d:
```
9. Start using...

## Troubleshooting

- On Bluetooth host mode if it doesn't connect on first, reboot and put your gamepad on pair mode.
- If it fails multiple times to connect on any bluetooth mode [reset the pico's flash](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html#resetting-flash-memory).
